#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engeneering is the systematic application of engeneering principles to design, develope, test, implement and maintain softwares.It involves applying structured and disciplined approach to building relliable, efficient and scallable software solutions.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The creation of High-level Programming languages(1950-1960)
   These languages include COBOL in 1959 and Fortan in 1957.These languages abstracted the complexity of machne code and allowed engineers to write programs in a more human-readable        form. This shift made programming more accessible and laid te groundwork for modern software development practices.
2.The Emergence of Structured Programming(1970)
   The emergence led to emphasis on the importance of a clear structure code led by Edsger Dijkstra who advocated for programming paradigms that made software easier to understand and       maintain. Structired programming introduced concepts such as control structures, procedures and modularization, leading to better organization of code and paved way for better            software development methodologies.
3.The Agile Manifesto(2001)
  The publication of The Agile manifesto in 20001 marked a revolutionary change in software development practices.Agile methodology prioritized flexibility, collaboration and customer/     end user feedback over the traditional, rigid processes like the Waterfall model. This shijft allowed teams to respond more effectively to changes and improve product derivery            timelines. These agile practices include Kanba and Scrum.


List and explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software development life cycle has the below phases;
     **Requirements Gathering and Analysis**: Understanding the needs of the users and stakeholders to define what the software should do.
     **Design:** Creating a blueprint for the software, outlining its architecture, components, and interfaces.  This often involves diagrams and models.
     **Implementation (Coding):** Writing the actual code using programming languages and frameworks.
     **Testing**: Verifying that the software functions correctly and meets the specified requirements, often involving various testing methodologies (unit, integration, system, etc.).
     **Deployment:** Releasing the software to users, which may involve deploying to servers, cloud platforms, or mobile app stores.
     **Maintenance:**  Addressing bugs, improving performance, adding new features, and adapting the software to changing requirements over time.
